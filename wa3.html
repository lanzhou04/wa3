<p>On 25 January 2011, a shocking and unusual trading activity happened and caught a lot of people's attention. The trading of GameStop increased from $18 to nearly $364.15. What's more, someone wrote a post about several most shorted retail stocks in Reddit and provoked a mania. </p>

<u1 class="a">
	<li style="font-size: 20px; color:red"> What are or should be the limits of using online social platforms to engage in collective action?</li>
	<p1>The limits using online social platforms to engage online trading activity are obvious. First, it’s easy that people’s mindset or behaviors would be shaped by the algorithm hidden in the collective action. Also, social media like reddit are dangerous and people should be aware of since information on reddit are spread so quickly and would always provoke people’s discussion and emotion since social media facilitate online activism, particularly by documenting and collating individual experiences, community building, norm formation, and development of shared realities. Taking this incidence as an example, when someone writes most shorted retail stocks in Reddit, people are so easily followed by this trend and believe it. And people are greatly emotional discussing this on Reddit. The information is overloaded and people sometimes follow the suggestion on Reddit without thinking of the consequences. People all know the negative consequences of dealing with shorted retail stocks but because of the effect of GameStop, some people are so willing to engage within those activities and we can see when you search shorted retail stocks on google, there is a lot of information and suggestions on this topic. And there is some dangerous information like shorted retail stocks which nobody bought yet.

<u2 class="b">
	<li style="font-size: 20px; color:red"> What kinds of policy changes are needed to govern the actors and organizations who participate in markets?</li>
	<p2>In addition, one of the potential reasons behind the incidence of GameStop is probably because of the regulation. People need to figure out a balance between freedom and regulation. Many people consider liberty as the primary value in terms of the stock market but it definitely should have someone interfere and restrict the liberty to a controllable extent, like the government. Government has many ways to control the trading trend and activities within the stock market and has the power to regulate any inappropriate behavior like fraud, etc. Regulators should investigate where the intense activity we saw in after hours trading yesterday was coming from and the platform should have the responsibility to inform or announce the traders and users any information which is essential and important. On the other hand, the platform should take an eye on every user(traders) and protect the user's privacy at the same time. Platform and company should know what information they pursue and how they should use the user's information properly. What should they be aware of when they are using or selling people’s information. And when users of Reddit post information or any suggestions to the public. Platforms like Reddit need to find an optimum way to control and regulate those posts. The regulators need to evaluate and check whether the information is appropriate and lead to a positive trend when posting to the public.

	<li style="font-size: 20px; color:red">Conclusion</li>
 	<Con>To conclude, we still have a lot of steps that need to be taken when regulating the stock market and people should remember, the internet is a real work and be aware of any trading activities. </Con>
